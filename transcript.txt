how much of that do you think is to do
with them having the wrong image of God
you you've you quote this Zen teaching
pointing at the
moon the finger that points at the Moon
is not the moon what does that
mean I don't know you tell me man I
don't oh did I write that the yeah
it's I have a chapter in the book called
The Notorious
god um uh and I I love this conversation
I love a conversation about God I don't
love a you know an old-fashioned YouTube
debate about whether God exists or not
yeah you kind of opened the chapter by
talking about how useless and fruitless
YouTube religion debates are yes yes
it's uh I wasn't going to mention that
but well I know it's I think it used to
be your bread and butter but I I greatly
admire how you've expanded your vision
to just
have just big meaty beautiful
conversations and challenge ing
conversations too as one should and I
hope you'll challenge me as well but
just having like you know Richard
Dawkins versus some priest and them
fighting it out and you know there's a
lot of kind of angry 23 year olds at
home going oh you landed a good point
there oh yeah you got him Dawkins um
it's kind of like Jake Paul vers just
thinking um and and it doesn't really
change uh the the atmosphere um but I do
think so the finger pointing at the moon
so um I think people often
confuse that so when when I read that in
your book I I thought of this I keep
quoting this poem by CS Lewis and
there's a point where he says thoughts
are but coins let me not trust in said
of thee their thin worn image of thy
head it's like people often worship
their thoughts more than they worship
the thing that their thoughts are
supposed to be directed to and so you
end up with these ideas of God and these
pictures in your head and isn't it vinin
who talks about the
Fishbowl I don't have the quote right on
the tip of my fingers something about
like how l no no fly fly glass we're
caught like flies caught in a glass and
the glass is the limitations of our
language to be able to summate stuff
that is you know beyond the Beyond and
we are stuck like FES popping around in
this fly glass because we our language
is so limited to trying and encapsulate
something that is kind of beyond our
current consciousness's understanding
it's impossible to comprehend just how
much our language restricts our thinking
I I only speak one language fluently
semi fluently I like to think uh and I
think that I think it was Gerta who said
of language he who knows one knows none
because without this comparison it's
difficult to even recognize the
constraints that that you have in your
language uh I did a podcast recently
with a the guy's got a channel called
magnify and he was talking about how the
the English language for example is
embedded with sort of accounting terms
it's it's very sort of trade based
because that was the society that this
language evolves in and so when you
apply it to religion it's Jesus
accounting you know for for for sins and
we're in in spiritual debt and these
kinds of language oh interesting look at
the way that religious language is is
completely embedded into the Arabic
language totally and the original word
for sin sin was a uh an ancient Greek
term of archery did you know this oh
like missing sin is missing the mark
thek yeah like you you know you're
you're doing this and like oh I I sinned
I didn't hit the bullseye so sin isn't
like this black mark on your soul that's
going to damn you to hell for eternity
it's you miss the mark and guess what
that's what we do all the time as human
beings is we miss the mark but uh again
and then that language got translated
when it got translated into into Latin
or or or whatever it was um it got
translated kind of Mis
misappropriated yeah as as so often
happens I think the history of
translation especially in religion is
something that needs a bit more Focus
because so much of our understanding of
theology can be affected by one person's
decision to to make did you have you
ever seen um paintings of Moses with
horns no a lot of the time if you see a
painting of so Michelangelo's famous
statue of Moses has horns on it w if you
go to the San Chappelle in Paris you see
on the Windows there are pictures of
Moses with horns wow and it's because
there's this word I think it's Ken uh in
in
Hebrew which can be translated as like
Rays as in like rays of light but it can
also be translated as horns it's like
the same word and so when St Jerome
makes the Vulgate the Latin translation
of the Bible he translates it literally
as horns so there's this passage in in
Exodus Moses comes down from the
mountain and he did not know that his
head was Ken because he'd been speaking
with the Lord so he did not know that
his face sha is how most translations
will happen but Jerome translates it as
he did not know that his face was horned
because he had been speaking with which
doesn't make much sense because like
five minutes later he has to cover up
his face because of the effect it's
having on people around him it's quite
clear that that's what it meant because
Drome translated it as horns you end up
seeing all this religious art with with
Moses having these these devilish horns
and I mean that's a that's quite a sort
of trivial example but you can imagine
that happening theologically it's not
just like the painting of Moses but your
conception of God is completely altered
by the fact that some concept has been
translated wrong and sin is a great
example of that I mean shifting your
perspective on sin from being this this
punch that you've landed on God or this
this wrong that you've committed that
you can sort of do an evil Giggle and
it's God who's kind of upset about it to
rather being it's you missing the mark
for yourself can can transform the way
that you interact with the world yeah
just by that one word I think yeah
there's uh one of my favorite stories
from the bahai faith is the son of the
of the founder bahah Abdul
Baha uh he came to the United States a
little over a hundred years ago and
toured around for about a year and um
when he landed and he was everyone he
was on the front page of the papers like
the Persian Prophet has landed and they
have pictures of him he's got a big
beard in a turban and stuff like that
and this um journalist said uh Abdul
Baha bah believe in Satan and ABD Baha
thought about it and ABD Baha was like
yes and they said oh what what how do
bah view Satan and Abdul Baha said Satan
is the insistent
self and I love that so much because
obviously bahis don't believe that
there's a red devil man with scales and
a pitchfork in a in an evil place like
trying to tempt
us but when you think about the
insistent self and you think about the
universality of religious faith and
religious belief the ego and the the
Allure of the ego of lust and passion
and power um is hardwired into our DNA
as well it should be because we are part
ape we're part you know we're part
animal we're maybe we're mostly animal
and
that's that's how we survived um was to
have our own self-interest to spread our
seed to seek power protect ourselves and
but that is the ego that is so much of
what Buddhism is about about um the the
the the need the clutching the the the
the the you know the need to possess um
that this is a source of great
unhappiness so this idea that that Satan
is not something outside of oursel but
something in our s and it's not an evil
power but in fact um something that we
all Wrestle with uh speaks to every uh
spiritual tradition who was it uh bahas
Abdul Bahar Abdul Bahar there's there's
a quote from Abdul Bahar on your book
okay page 98 for those following along
at home um people have pictured a God in
the realm of their mind in the realm of
the mind and worship that image which
they have made for themselves
consider then how all the peoples of the
world are bowing the knee to a fancy of
their own contriving how they have
created a Creator within their own minds
and they call it the fashioner of all
that is it's people worshiping their
thoughts rather than worshiping the
thing that their thoughts are supposed
to point to yeah I think that so Thomas
aquinus uh famously thought that all
religious language was analogy and so
God is Not powerful God is Not is not
knowing God is not you know any of these
things because these are human Concepts
that we used to sort of analogously
think about the way that that that God
kind of operates but he's obviously not
powerful in the way that a human is
powerful being able to lift heavy things
and and influence people and stuff like
that it's a it's a totally
incomprehensible notion but we use these
analogous terms but now if you ask the
philosophers even you know how do you
define God they'll say oh he's an all
powerful all loving you know uh all
knowing and and and perhaps
pointing at the Moon Yeah pointing at
the thinking about the finger the
pointing at the finger itself you know
which is probably the wrong way of
thinking about I I think a lot of um
David Bentley Hart seems like someone
that you've you've read yes and I'm
pretty sure that one of his biggest
critiques of the new atheism movement is
that they're just thinking of the wrong
kind of God they've just got the wrong
picture of what God is supposed to be I
mean what what do you think God is
supposed to
be well that's the ultimate question
isn't it um
well yeah because you could go even
further than that and you can say that
to exist is a quality of the physical
world you know this this pen exists does
God
exist does God have the same quality
that this pen has right right you know
you can't say that God exists but again
that's that's how trapped we are by
Language by language yeah so yeah I I
love David Bentley Hart uh the
experience of God uh his book is is uh
as a seminal book for me and that really
illumined a a new way of thinking about
God and I have a chapter in there I
referenced before the notorious God and
I'm actually doing a uh a
documentary I'm going to start next year
doing a documentary called The Notorious
geod I'd love to interview you for for
it are you up for that that sounds like
great fun okay and but this idea that
God is much closer to an experience than
a being with superpowers yeah so Jesus
said God is love
and and the hippies were right in a way
like can God be closer to something more
akin to music than to a dude you know uh
David benley Hart calls him like a
demiurge that's this old idea of like a
god with superpowers on a on a cloud
like striking you and giving you favors
and like and and having opinions and
whatnot can God be closer to
physics and Beauty than to any kind of
being you know that's the that's what so
many people are striving to understand
through psychedelics you know I'm not
I'm not a huge fan but I'm also an
addict so I can't do them so maybe if I
wasn't I'd enjoy them who knows but um
but that uh reaching for something
Beyond again that reaching for something
uh Transcendent and when I experience
God the
most um I experience God in nature I
experience God I think the closest I've
ever come to God was at a radio head
concert and I saw radio head at the
Hollywood Bowl and song after song after
song from In Rainbows came up and I was
just like my face was melting and I felt
one with the world and I just felt love
and abulance and joy and I was just
absolutely
mesmerized and transformed and and I was
like this is a religious this is like
the most religious experience I've ever
had if you enjoyed that clip you can
